# Original data source:
#     o Table I, Mayo et al. [ Ref 88 ]
#
# Notes:
#     o 37 DREIDING atom types are listed
#     o AtomTypes::DREIDINGAtomTypes.pm module is used to assign DREIDING atom types
#     o Units: 
#         o ValenceBondRadius and NonBondRadius: Angstroms
#         o ValenceAngle: Degrees
#     o Five-character mnemonic label for DREIDING atom types
#         o First two characters correspond to chemical symbol with an underscore as second
#           character for elements with one character symbol
#         o Third character describes hybridization: 1 - linear (sp); 2 - trigonal (sp2);
#           3 = tetrahedral (sp3); R - sp2 involved in resonance situation
#         o Fourth character used to indicate number of implicit hydrogens
#         o Fourth and fifth characters are used as indicators of alternate parameters: formal oxidation
#           state, bridging hydrogens and so on. The _HB type denotes a hydrogen atom capable
#           of forming hydrogen bonds attached to (N, O, F). The H_b is the bridging hydrogen
#           of diborane.
