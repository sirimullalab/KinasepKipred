#     o Data extracted from information provided by Roger through personal
#       communication and formatted into the current format
#     o Formal charge and common valence information is used to calculate the
#       number of implicit hydrogens on an atom during MDL valence model
#     o For elements not listed in this file or the listed elements with no explicit
#       formal charge, no implicit hydrogens are added to atoms during MDL
#       valence model
