# Notes:
#     o 53 - 8 = 45 SYBYL atom types are listed 
#     o AtomTypes::SYBYLAtomTypes.pm module is used to assign SYBYL atom types
#     o 8 SYBYL atom types are not listed and not assigned to any atom:
#
#         O.spc - oxygen in SPC water model
#         O.t3p - oxygen in TIP3P water model
#         H.spc - hydrogen in SPC water model
#         H.t3p - hydrogen in TIP3P water model
#         Du - dummy
#         Du.C - dummy with the weight of carbon
#         HEV - heavy (non H) atom
#         LP - lone pair
#
#     o N.pl3 atom type is assigned to Nitrogens in a guadinium group attached
#       to Carbon C.cat
