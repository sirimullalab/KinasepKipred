# Notes:
#  . What is aromaticity? [ Ref 124 ] It's in the code of the implementer, did you
#    say? Agree. The implementation of aromaticity varies widely across different
#    packages [ Ref 125 ]; additionally, the implementation details are not always
#    completely available, and it's not possible to figure out the exact implementation
#    of aromaticity across various packages. Using the publicly available information,
#    however, one can try to reproduce the available results to the extent possible,
#    along with parameterizing all the control parameters used to implement different
#    aromaticity models, and that's exactly what the current release of MayaChemTools
#    does.
#  . Molecule.pm module retrieves data from this file during class instantiation
#    and makes it available to class method DetectAromaticity for detecting
#    aromaticity corresponding to a specific model.
#  . Any new added aromaticity model using existing parameters would work
#    as expected, without modifying the code; addition of new parameters,
#    however, requires its implementation in the code.
#  . Parameter values of Yes, No and None are internally mapped to 1, 0 and
#    an empty string, respectively.
#  . For parameter names containing List in their name and comma delimited set
#    of values, a new parameter is generated for each model by appending MapRef
#    to specified parameter name, which is then assigned a hash reference containing
#    key and value pairs corresponding to comma delimited values.
