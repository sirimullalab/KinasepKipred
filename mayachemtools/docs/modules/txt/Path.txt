    use Graph::Path qw(:all);

DESCRIPTION
    Path class provides the following methods:

    new, AddVertex, AddVertices, Copy, GetCommonVertices, GetEdges,
    GetEndVertex, GetLength, GetStartVertex, GetTerminalVertices, GetVertex,
    GetVertices, IsCycle, IsIndependentCyclicPath, IsIndependentPath,

    Path is a sequential list of vertices with an edge between two
    successive vertices. The path becomes a cycle when start vertex and end
    vertex are the same.

    The following operators are overloaded:

        "" == eq

  METHODS
    new
            $NewPath = new Path();
            $NewPath = new Path(@VertexIDs);

        Using specified *VertexIDs*, new method creates a new Path object
        and returns newly created Path object.

    AddVertex
            $Path->AddVertex($VertexID);

        Adds *VertexID* to *Path* and returns *Path*.

    AddVertices
            $Path->AddVertices(@VertexIDs);

        Adds vertices using *VertexIDs* to *Path* and returns *Graph*.

    Copy
            $Return = $Path->Copy();

        Copies *Path* and its associated data using Storable::dclone and
        returns a new Path object.

    GetCommonVertices
            @CommonVertices = $Path->GetCommonVertices($OtherPath);
            $NumOfCommonVertices = $Path->GetCommonVertices($OtherPath);

        Returns an array containing common vertex IDs between two paths. In
        scalar context, number of common vertices is returned.

    GetEdges
            @EdgesVertexIDs = $Path->GetEdges();
            $NumOfEdges = $Path->GetEdges();

        Returns an array containg successive paris of vertex IDs
        corresponding to all edges in *Path*. In scalar context, the number
        of edges is returned.

    GetEndVertex
            $VertexID = $Path->GetEndVertex();

        Returns VertexID of end vertex in *Path*.

    GetLength
            $Length = $Path->GetLength();

        Returns Length of *Path* corresponding to number of vertices in
        *Path*.

    GetStartVertex
            $VertexID = $Path->GetStartVertex();

        Returns VertexID of start vertex in *Path*.

    GetTerminalVertices
            ($StartVertexID, $EndVertexID) = $Path->GetTerminalVertices();

        Returns vertex IDs of start and end vertices in *Path*.

    GetVertex
            $VertexID = $Path->GetVertex($Index);

        Returns specific vertex ID from *Path* corresponding to *Index* with
        indicies starting from 0.

    GetVertices
            @Vertices = $Path->GetVertices();
            $NumOfVertices = $Path->GetVertices();

        Returns an array containing all vertex IDs in *Path*. In scalar
        context, number of vertices is returned.

    IsCycle
            $Status = $Path->IsCycle();

        Returns 1 or 0 based on whether *Path* is a CyclicPath which has the
        same start and end vertex IDs.

    IsIndependentCyclicPath
            $Status = $Path->IsIndependentCyclicPath();

        Returns 1 or 0 based on whether *Path* is an independent CyclicPath.
        For a *Path* to be an independent cyclic path, it must be a cyclic
        path and have unique vertices.

    IsIndependentPath
            $Status = $Path->IsIndependentPath();

        Returns 1 or 0 based on whether *Path* is an independent Path. For a
        *Path* to be an independent path, it must have unique vertices.

    IsPath
            $Status = Graph::Path::IsPath();

        Returns 1 or 0 based on whether *Object* is a Path object

    Join
            $NewPath = $Path->Join($OtherPath);
            $NewPath = $Path->Join(@VertexIDs);

        Joins existing *Path* with a new path specified as a *OtherPath*
        object or an array of *VertexIDs* and returns *NewPath*.

        In order to successfully join two paths, terminal vertices must have
        a common vertex. Based on the common terminal vertex found,
        additional path vertices are added to the current *Path* in one of
        the following four ways:

            . EndVertex = NewStartVertex: New path at end of current path with
              same vertices order

            . EndVertex = NewEndVertex: New path at end of current path with
              reversed vertices order

            . StartVertex = NewEndVertex: New path at front of current path
              with same vertices order

            . StartVertex = NewStartVertex: New path at front of current path
              with reversed vertices order

    JoinAtVertex
            $NewPath = $Path->JoinAtVertex($OtherPath, $CenterVertexID);

        Joins existing *Path* with *OtherPath* at a specified
        *CeterVertexID* and returns a *NewPath*.

    PopVertex
            $Path->PopVertex();

        Removes end vertex from *Path* and returns *Path*.

    PushVertex
            $Path->PushVertex($VertexID);

        Adds *VertexID* to *Path* after end vertex and returns *Path*.

    PushVertices
            $Path->PushVertices(@VertexIDs);

        Adds *VertexIDs* to *Path* after end vertex and returns *Path*.

    Reverse
            $Path->Reverse();

        Reverses order of vertices in *Path* and returns *Path*.

    ShiftVertex
            $Path->ShiftVertex();

        Removes start vertex from *Path* and returns *Path*.

    StringifyPath
            $String = $Path->StringifyPath();

        Returns a string containing information about *Path* object.

    UnshiftVertex
            $Path->UnshiftVertex($VertexID);

        Adds *VertexID* to *Path* before start vertex and returns *Path*.

    UnshiftVertices
            $Path->UnshiftVertices(@VertexIDs);

        Adds *VertexIDs* to *Path* before start vertex and returns *Path*.
