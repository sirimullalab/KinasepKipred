# Original data source:
#     o Table 1, Ertl et al. [ Ref 90 ]
#
# Notes:
#     o 47 TPSA atom types are listed
#     o AtomTypes::TPSAAtomTypes.pm module is used to assign TPSA atom types using
#       an internal atom environment detection methodology. SMARTS strings are listed for
#       reference purposed and are not used by TPSAAtomTypes.pm module.
#     o AtomType symbols were not used in publication by Ertl et al; these are assigned and
#       used only by MayaChemTools.
#         o Number in AtomType symbol for an element simply correspond to its order of
#            appearance in Table 1 [ Ref 90-91 ]
#
#     o N, O, P and S are used to indicate atom environments not explicitly defined in Table1.
#        And their TPSA contributions are dynamically calculated using formulas from TPSA.c
#        code developed by Peter Ertl :
#
#         o N = 30.5 - X*8.2 + H*1.5 or 0.0 for negative value
#         o O = 28.5 - X*8.6 + H*1.5 or 0.0 for negative value
#       
#         where X = Number of heavy atom neighbors; H = Number of implicit and explicit
#         hydrogen atom neighbors
#  
#         o P = 0.0
#         o O = 0.0
#
#     o Number of atom type symbols for:
#         o N: 27
#         o O: 7
#         o P: 5
#         o S: 8
