# Original data source:
#     o Table 1, Wildman et al. [ Ref 89 ]
#
# Notes:
#     o 72 SLogP atom types are listed 
#     o AtomTypes::SLogPAtomTypes.pm module is used to assign ALogP atom types using
#       an internal atom environment detection methodology. SMARTS strings are listed for
#       reference purposed and are not used by SLogPAtomTypes.pm module.
#     o For AtomTypeSymbols - N10, N12, O12, Hal, Me2 -not parametrized for MR contribution,
#        the AtomTypeSymbols are mapped to supplemental atom types or other atom types and
#        the MR values of mapped AtomTypeSymbols are used:
#         o N10 - NS
#         o N12 - NS 
#         o O12 - OS
#         o Hal - Me1
#         o Me2 - Me1
#
#     o SMARTS description [ Copied from Ref 89 ]
#
#         o 'A' and 'a' are used to represent any non-hydrogen aliphatic and aromatic element,
#           respectively. This includes Carbon.
# 
#         o '[#X]' is used to specify any non-hydrogen, non-carbon element, and
#           aromaticity may be specified by including the appropriate 'A' or 'a', as in '[A#X]'
#           or '[a#X]'.
# 
#         o '[#N]' specifies any element in the subset of elements O, N, F, Cl, and Br,
#           subject to the same aromaticity control.
# 
#         o Common organic elements (B, C, N, O, P, S, F, Cl, Br, and I) may be specified
#           by their symbol, where the lower case (b, c, n, o, p, s) would indicate aromaticity.
#           Other elements may be specified using '[# atomic number]', with 'A' and 'a' again as
#           aromaticity controls, such that '[a#7]' indicates an aromatic Nitrogen, as does 'n'.
# 
#         o Symbols -, =, #, and : indicate single, double, triple, and aromatic bonds, respectively.
#           Absence of a specific bond symbol implies a single or aromatic bond.
# 
#         o The number of attached hydrogens is specified using H, so '[CH4]' would match the
#           Carbon in methane. Charge is indicated with + and - such that '[#7+*]' indicates a
#           positively charged Nitrogen.
# 
#         o 'X' without '#' is used to specify the total number of bonds, including those to implicit
#           hydrogens, so '[CX4]' would match the Carbon in methane as well as the quaternary
#           Carbon of a tert-butyl group. All other notation follows that of the original SMARTS.
#
#     o Number of atom type symbols for:
#         o C: 28
#         o N: 15
#         o O: 13
#         o P: 1
#         o S: 3
#         o H: 5
#         o F, Cl, Br, I: 1 each
#         o Ionic halogen: 1
#         o p-block elements: 1
#         o d-block elements: 1
