# Original data sources:
#     o Table 2 in Yuan et al. [ Ref 93 ]
#     o PeriodicTableElementsData.csv supplied with MayaChemTools
#
# Notes:
#     o The current release of MayaChemTools provide data van der Waals atom radii and atom
#        volumes data for 38 elements. Table 2 [ Ref 93 ] contains data for 15 elements.
# 
#     o After converting valid van der Waals atom radius data from pm (picometer) to A (Angstrom)
#        A (Angstrom) available under column name VanderWaalsRadius in PeriodicTableElementsData.csv
#        data file, van der Waals atom volume is calculated using: 4/3 * PI * (Radius ** 3)
#
#     o For elements specified in Table 2 [ Ref 93 ] - H, B, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, As, Se, Br, Te, I -
#        van der Waals atom radii and calculated atom volumes match the values in the table.
